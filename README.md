Flight Delay Prediction ✈️
📖 Description

This project focuses on predicting flight delays using data analysis and machine learning.
The Jupyter Notebook GrpP2flightdelay.ipynb contains all the steps starting from data preprocessing to building models for prediction.
The goal is to understand the main reasons behind flight delays and to create a system that can predict whether a flight will be delayed or not.

⚙️ Process

Data Loading – Import the dataset into the notebook

Data Cleaning – Handle missing values and prepare the data

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualize and understand data patterns

Feature Engineering – Convert categorical values and scale the data

Model Building – Train different machine learning models

Model Evaluation – Compare results using accuracy and other metrics

Prediction – Use the best model to predict flight delays
